# Maxixe

This will respond to requests from [vrfy](https://github.com/reed-college/vrfy) in the same way that [Tango](https://github.com/autolab/Tango) does so that you can test all of vrfy in local dev without setting up Tango.

### Setup
- Run `pip install git+git://github.com/reed-college/maxixe.git` to install
- Run `mockTango` to run the server
